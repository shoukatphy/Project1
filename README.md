The **rndm.C** will generate random numbers and it will aslo save the data in two different files.  Whereas, the **DecayAnalysis.C** program will analyse the data generated by the previous program.
## How to run the two Programs?
This code can be run through *ROOT*. In case you don't have it in your system, you can install from here [https://root.cern/install/](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
The two files ask for an argument. So you can pass an integer value for it. This value will be equal to the number of the trials. Open the root terminal and then type root[0] **`.x rndm.C(10000)`** . For the analysing program do the samething as type root[0] **`.x DecayAnalysis.C(5000)`**
